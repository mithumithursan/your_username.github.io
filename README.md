<div align="center">The derogatory term “scrub” means several different things. One
definition is someone (especially a game player) who is not good at something (especially a
game). By this definition, we all start out as scrubs, and there is certainly no shame in that. I
mean the term differently, though. A scrub is a player who is handicapped by self-imposed
rules that the game knows nothing about. A scrub does not play to win.<div align="center">
